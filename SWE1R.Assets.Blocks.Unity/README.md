# SWE1R.Assets.Blocks.Unity

A Unity project containing code to import, modify, and re-export assets. Like SWE1R.Assets.Blocks, it allows for bit-perfect re-exporting, meaning that if you import a block item (e.g., a model), make no changes in the Unity Editor, and export it again, the output binary data will be identical to the input data. Changing certain values will only alter the respective bytes in the output.
